            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>To all Our Loving subjects of Our Ancient Kingdome of Scotland Greeting.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEREAS it has pleased Almighty God to put it into our power to answer the earnest desires and longing expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Our Friends, by returning to Our Kingdome of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, with such à considerable Army as may enable our faithfull subjects to declare for US, without any danger from their Enemies. WE have thought fitt, to declare the same to you our Ancient People, That you may have your share in the honor of reestablishing US your Lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne to our Crowns, and we the satisfaction of restoreing you to your Rights and Priviledges again, which have for this time past been trampled on by the Usurpers the Prince and Princesse of Orange and their Adherents: who having made use of the falsest Calumnies as well as of illegall force to drive US from our Kingdoms, have enslaved our People, and under the false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of softening the Government and freeing the subjects, have brought in a Tyranny and barbarity never heard of in the bypast Reignes of Our glorious Predecessors or our own, of which the inhumane nourthers committed lately in cold blood upon the Inhabitants of Glenco is too true and too horrid an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as well as à fair warning of what our People would have to expect from the Usurper in time to come, should he be in liberty to pull off the masque and shew his naturall Temper, which how much it differs from the meeknesse and gentlenesse of our Reigne, there is no Scotsman but must in his conscience be convinced of, especially if he consider the numbers who must have fallen by the severity of the Laws if Our Mercy had not saved them.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:110010:2"/>
            <p> The Confusion the Government has been brought into by this infortunate Revolution we are resolved to remedy by the Advice of à Free Parliament which we intend to call immediatly after Our Restauration by whose advice we will settle the Rights, Liberties and Propertys of Our People.</p>
            <p>And since We think Liberty of Conscience most consonant with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Christian Religion, as we will protect and maintain the Church established by Law in all their Legall Rights and possessions, so We will endeavour to find such means of settleing the minds of Our subjects in matters of Religion as may consist with the wellfare and happinesse of Our People, it being Our designe to advance the interest of the Nation in generall on sure and lasting foundations in Church and State.</p>
            <p>The which that we may the better effectuate We command and require all Our Loving subjects to declare for US and to assist US to the utmost of their power against the Usurper and his Adherents and to joyn those Commissiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by US for the asserting of Our Authority: Declareing that as we are resolved to reward such as shall be forward and zealous on this occasion, so We will punish severely all who shall resist Our Authority.</p>
            <p>And that none may be discouraged from serving US through the guilt they at this present lye under, We declare that We will and do hereby give our full Pardon and indemnity to all Our subjects of that Our Ancient Kingdom of Scotland for all Crimes committed against US, who shall own our Authority and declare for US immediatly after notice given hereof.

But if after this there shall be any who shall resist our Authority and draw their Native Kingdome into à Civill warr, As the ruine they will bring upon themselves will be unpittied, so the Innocent blood shed by their wickednesse will lye heavy on their guilty heads</p>
